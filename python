""" In a local school, the teacher is organizing a number game for kids where each child is asked to call out all odd numbers from 1 up to a given number N. The teacher needs a program that can assist in generating this list of odd numbers to quickly verify the children's answers.



The program should take a positive integer n and return a list of odd numbers from 1 to N (inclusive, if N is odd). The list should be printed in a single line, with odd numbers separated by commas.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer N, representing the upper limit for generating odd numbers.

Output format :
The output prints a single line containing a comma-separated list of odd numbers from 1 to N.
